# Figma - Poster shop

Simple poster shop desktop layout. You will recreate this poster shop application from the screen shots below. There are two pages, which means you will need two HTML documents. The purpose here is to either use flex or grid in order to create the same layout as the screen shots. Or, if you dare, create two versions of the poster shop, one using flex and one using grid.
